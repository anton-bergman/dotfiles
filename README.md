# dotfiles

This repository contains the dotfiles for configuring my development environment, including terminal settings, plugins, and other personal customizations.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

1. **Homebrew:** Ensure Homebrew is installed. You can install it via:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2. **iTerm2:** Install your terminal of choice. I prefer iTerm2 (recommended for macOS), install it using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install --cask iterm2
```

### Install dotfiles

To set up your development environment, run the following installation script. This will install required software, clone necessary plugins, and set up your dotfiles.

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anton-bergman/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
```

2. Run the `install.sh` script to set up your environment:

```bash
cd ~/dotfiles && ./install.sh
```

The script `install.sh` will:

- Install **Oh-My-Posh**.
- Install the **Hack Nerd Font**.
- Clone zsh plugins.
- Set up symbolic links for the dotfiles.

### Install Neovim Configuration

This repository also includes my Neovim configuration. To set up Neovim and related dependencies, run the `install_nvim.sh` script:

```bash
cd ~/dotfiles && ./install_nvim.sh
```

The script install_nvim.sh will:

- Install packages Neovim, LuaRocks, Ripgrep (required for Telescope fuzzy finding).
- Set up symbolic links for the Neovim configuration.

This Neovim configuration includes:

- **Lazy.nvim** as the plugin manager.
- Pre-installed plugins for autocompletions, LSP support, color theme, syntax highlighting and more.

To start using Neovim, simply run:

```bash
nvim
```

If you wish to update Neovim plugins, run the following inside Neovim:

```bash
:Lazy sync
```

### Managing zsh Plugins

This **dotfiles** repository includes custom plugins for zsh. To install or update the plugins, you can run the `install.sh` and `update.sh` scripts:

- **To install the plugins for the first time:** Run `install.sh` as mentioned above. This will clone the plugins: `zsh-autosuggestions`, `zsh-syntax-highlighting`, and `zsh-completions` and set them up.

- **To update existing plugins:** Run the `update.sh` script to pull the latest changes from the plugin repositories:

```bash
cd ~/dotfiles && ./update.sh
```

2. **Disable Dimming on Inactive Split Panes:**

   - Navigate to `Settings` > `Appearance` > `Dimming`.

### Customize Terminal Color Theme and Prompt Theme

This repository includes a collection of custom color themes for iTerm2 and prompt themes for Oh-My-Posh.

- **Oh-My-Posh Prompt Theme:** Create or customize your own Oh-My-Posh prompt theme by modifying or adding YAML configuration files located under `dotfiles/oh-my-posh`. These themes can be easily switched by changing the theme path in the configuration file `dotfiles/zshrc`.

- **iTerm2 Color Theme:** To customize the color theme of your iTerm2 terminal you have two main options.

  - **Download a Theme:** Download a iTerm2 color theme from [iTerm2 Color Schemes](https://iterm2colorschemes.com/).

  - **Create your own theme / Customize an existing theme:** To create your own theme or customize an existing theme, navigate to `Settings` > `Profiles` > `Colors`. From there, you can tweak the colors to your liking. Once you have customized a theme, save it under `dotfiles/iterm2-color-themes` by selecting `Color Presets` > `Export`.
